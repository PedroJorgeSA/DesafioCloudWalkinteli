# **App Name**: InfiniteMind

## Core Features:

- Intelligent Query Routing: Automatically route user queries to the most appropriate agent (Aura, Nexus, or Sabio) based on keywords and context. The routing logic must be replicated exactly as in the original prompt.
- Aura: Knowledge Curation: Maintain and provide access to a curated knowledge base of InfinitePay's products, services, and policies.
- Nexus: Financial Insights: Analyze user financial data to provide insights, reports, and trends.
- Sabio: Financial Education: Offer educational content and guidance on financial management and business strategies tailored for Brazilian PMEs. When providing responses, Sabio must act as a tool to improve financial literacy by sharing rules or concepts related to the requested topics. Under no circumstances will it give investment advice.
- Real-time Chat Interface: Display an agent's responses in a chat format within a web interface, including timestamps and confidence levels. The selected agent should also be visually emphasized in the UI (gold color, pulsing animation).
- Interactive Example Queries: Implement clickable example questions that pre-populate the query input, demonstrating each agent's capabilities.
- Agent Highlighting: Visually indicate the active agent, e.g., make the font golden and give it a subtle pulse effect. Note: Currently only the agents defined in the prompt are supported.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric Purple (#BE52F2) for a modern and vibrant feel.
- Background color: Very dark grayish-purple (#201A23), contributing to a professional but innovative style.
- Accent color: Fluorescent Cyan (#3FF9DC) for interactive elements and highlights to create contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif typeface, for a modern, neutral, and highly readable look. 
- Use minimalist, geometric icons for key features and agent representation.
- Maintain a clean and modern layout with generous whitespace to ensure readability and focus on key information.
- Incorporate subtle fade-in effects for messages and pulse animations for the active agent to create a smooth and engaging user experience.
